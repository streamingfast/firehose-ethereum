// Block is the representation of the tracing of a block in the Ethereum
// blockchain. A block is a collection of [TransactionTrace] that are grouped
// together and processed as an atomic unit. Each [TransactionTrace] is composed
// of a series of [Call] (a.k.a internal transactions) and there is also at
// least one call per transaction a.k.a the root call which essentially has the
// same parameters as the transaction itself (e.g. `from`, `to`, `gas`, `value`,
// etc.).
//
// The exact tracing method used to build the block must be checked against
// [DetailLevel] field. There is two levels of details available, `BASE` and
// `EXTENDED`. The `BASE` level has been extracted using archive node RPC calls
// and will contain only the block header, transaction receipts and event logs.
// Refers to the Firehose service provider to know which blocks are offered on
// each network.
//
// The `EXTENDED` level has been extracted using the Firehose tracer and all
// fields are available in this Protobuf.
//
// The Ethereum block model is used across many chains which means that it
// happen that certain fields are not available in one chain but are available
// in another. Each field should be documented when necesssary if it's available
// on a subset of chains.
//
// One major concept to get about the Block is the concept of 'ordinal'. The
// ordinal is a number that is used to globally order every element of execution
// that happened throughout the processing of the block like
// [TransactionTracer], [Call], [Log], [BalanceChange], [StateChange], etc.
// Element that have a start and end interval, [Transaction] and [Call], will
// have two ordinals: `begin_ordinal` and `end_ordinal`. Element that are
// executed as "point in time" [Log], [BalanceChange], [StateChange], etc. will
// have only one ordinal named `ordinal`. If you take all of the message in the
// Block that have an 'ordinal' field in an array and you sort each element
// against the `ordinal` field, you will get the exact order of execution of
// each element in the block.
//
// All the 'ordinal' fields in a block are globally unique for the given block,
// it is **not** a chain-wide global ordering. Furthermore, caution must be take
// with reverted elements due to execution failure. For anything attached to a
// [Call] that has a `state_reverted` field set to `true`, the `ordinal` field
// is not reliable and should not be used to order the element against other
// elements in the block as those element might have 0 as the ordinal. Only
// successful calls have a reliable `ordinal` field.

  // state for **some** of the state changes. Indeed, in those cases, the transactions fees are still paid to the miner
  // which means there is a balance change for the transaction's emitter (e.g. `from`) to pay the gas fees, an optional
  // balance change for gas refunded to the transaction's emitter (e.g. `from`) and a balance change for the miner who
  // received the transaction fees. There is also a nonce change for the transaction's emitter (e.g. `from`).
  //
  // This means that to properly record the state changes for a transaction, you need to conditionally procees the
  // transaction's status.
  //
  // For a `SUCCEEDED` transaction, you iterate over the `calls` array and record the state changes for each call for
  // which `state_reverted == false` (if a transaction succeeded, the call at #0 will always `state_reverted == false`
  // because it aligns with the transaction).

  // For a `FAILED` or `REVERTED` transaction, you iterate over the root call (e.g. at #0, will always exist) for
